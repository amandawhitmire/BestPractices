## Best Practice
Data measurement descriptions should:

- Describe data collection methods or protocols(can include diagrams, images, schematics, etc.)
  - How the data were collected
  - Measurement frequency and regularity
- Describe instrumentation
  - Include manufacturer, model number, dates in use
  - Maintenance/repair history
  - Malfunction history
  - Calibration methods, scale, detection limits, and history
- Document measurement uncertainty, including accuracy, precision, and reproducibility. Provide values in the context of the measurements, e.g., standard error, standard deviation, confidence limits.

## Description Rationale
Describe how data were collected in enough detail for others to reproduce the measurements, assess the appropriateness of the measurements, and/or assess comparability of the data with other datasets.
