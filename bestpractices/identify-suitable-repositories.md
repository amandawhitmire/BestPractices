## Best Practice
Shaping the data management plan towards a specific desired repository will increase the likelihood that the data will be accepted into that repository and increase the discoverability of the data within the desired repository. When beginning a data management plan:
- Look to the data management guidelines of the project/grant for a required repository
- Ask colleagues what repositories are used in the community
- Determine if your local institution has a repository that would be appropriate (and might be required) for depositing your data
- Check the DataONE website for a list of potential repositories.

## Description Rationale
Shaping the data management plan towards a specific desired repository will increase the likelihood that the data will be accepted into that repository and increase the discoverability of the data within the desired repository.
